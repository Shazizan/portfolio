# 🧩 Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Engineering Portfolio** repository!  
This repo showcases my coding projects using **Python**, **Pandas** and **PySpark** for building **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipelines and data workflows.  
As I’m still learning, this repository also serves as a space for **experimentation, practice, and documenting my progress** in data engineering.

## 📁 Repository Overview

This repository is a collection of my **learning journey in data engineering**.  
It contains scripts and notebooks that I’ve created while exploring how **ETL pipelines** work using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **PySpark**.

As I continue learning, I’ll keep adding more examples and experiments related to:
- 🔹 Extracting data from different sources (CSV, Parquet, APIs, and more)  
- 🔹 Transforming and cleaning data using Pandas or PySpark  
- 🔹 Validating and preparing data for analysis or reporting  
- 🔹 Loading data into storage systems like databases or Parquet files

## 🚀 Featured Projects

| Project / File | Description | Key Tools |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| `etl_vault_pd_bank_cust_insight.ipynb` | ETL on bank customer data using Pandas for insights | Python, Pandas |
| `etl_vault_pd_stock_price.ipynb` | ETL pipeline for processing stock price data | Python, Pandas |
| `etl_vault_ps_csv_order_item.ipynb` | ETL on order item CSV data using PySpark | PySpark |
| `etl_vault_ps_realtime_crypto_by_coingecko.ipynb` | ETL pipeline fetching real-time cryptocurrency data from Coingecko API | Python, PySpark |
